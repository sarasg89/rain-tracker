# Weather forecast

## Description

This application retrieves weather data using the API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

The user is able to enter the name of a city into a form and the 5-day weather forecast for that city is displayed on screen, which includes the city name, date, temperature, humidity and wind speed, as well as icons representing the weather conditions.

Every time the user searches for a new city, this is added to the search history. The user can click on the names of those cities and see current weather conditions.
